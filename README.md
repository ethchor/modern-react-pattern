# Modern React Pattern⚛️

A simple, scalable, and powerful architecture for building production ready React applications.

## Introduction

React stands as a powerful framework for frontend development, boasting a rich ecosystem with numerous libraries addressing virtually any requirement. Yet this abundance of choices can be daunting for developers. While React offers exceptional flexibility, allowing for various implementation approaches, this freedom often results in disorganized, inconsistent, and unnecessarily complex code when there's no standardized architecture to follow.

This repository presents a curated approach to React application development, combining premier ecosystem tools with a scalable project structure. Drawing from extensive experience across multiple codebases, this architectural pattern has proven particularly effective.

The repository aims to compile resources and best practices for React development, demonstrating practical solutions to common real-world challenges and guiding developers toward creating superior applications.

For maximum benefit, we encourage you to examine the included sample application code.

## What makes a React application "Modern"?

This repo it tries to provide a solid foundation for building applications based on the following principles:

- Easy to get started with
- Simple to understand and maintain
- Uses the right tools for the job
- Clean boundaries between different parts of the application
- Everyone on the team is on the same page when it comes to how things are done
- Secure
- Performant
- Scalable in terms of codebase and team size
- Issues detectable as early as possible

#### Disclaimer:

This is not supposed to be a template, boilerplate or a framework. It is an opinionated guide that shows how to do some things in a certain way. You are not forced to do everything exactly as it is shown here, decide what works best for you and your team and stay consistent with your style.

To get most out of it, do not get limited by the technologies used in this sample app, but rather focus on the principles and the concepts that are being presented here. The tools and libraries used here are just a suggestion, you can always replace them with something that fits your needs better. Sometimes, your project might require a slightly different approach, and that's totally fine.
